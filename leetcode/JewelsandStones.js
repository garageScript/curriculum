// https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/

/*
You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels,
and S representing the stones you have. Each character in S is a type
of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in
J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a"
is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3

Example 2:

Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0

/**
 * @param {string} J
 * @param {string} S
 * @return {number}
 */

var numJewelsInStones = function(J, S) {
    
};

console.log(numJewelsInStones("aA", "aAAbbbb"));
// Output: 3

console.log(numJewelsInStones("z", "ZZ"));
// Output: 0
