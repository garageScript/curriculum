// https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-weight/

/*
Given an array w of positive integers,
where w[i] describes the weight of index i,
write a function pickIndex which randomly picks an index in proportion to its weight.

Note:

1 <= w.length <= 10000
1 <= w[i] <= 10^5
pickIndex will be called at most 10000 times.
Example 1:

Input:
["Solution","pickIndex"]
[[[1]],[]]
Output: [null,0]
Example 2:

Input:
["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,0,1,1,1,0]
Explanation of Input Syntax:

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments.

Solution's constructor has one argument, the array w. pickIndex has no arguments.

Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.

/**
 * @param {number[]} w
 */
var Solution = function(w) {

};

/**
 * @return {number}
 */
Solution.prototype.pickIndex = function() {

};

/**
 * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * var obj = new Solution(w)
 * var param_1 = obj.pickIndex()
 */
