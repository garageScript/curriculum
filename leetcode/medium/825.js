/*
Some people will make friend requests. The list of their ages is given and ages[i] is the age of the ith person. 

Person A will NOT friend request person B (B != A) if any of the following conditions are true:

age[B] <= 0.5 * age[A] + 7
age[B] > age[A]
age[B] > 100 && age[A] < 100
Otherwise, A will friend request B.

Note that if A requests B, B does not necessarily request A.  Also, people will not friend request themselves.

How many total friend requests are made?
