# Trees

# Write a function that....

1. Takes in the root node of a tree, a value, and returns how many times the value shows up in the tree
2. Takes in the root node of a tree, a value, and returns an array of all nodes larger than the value
3. Takes in the root node of a tree, a function, and changes all the values of each node. Pass in the value into the function, and set the value to the result of the function
4. Takes in the root node of a tree, a number, and returns all nodes at level number. Number 1 is the first level, number 2 is the second level, etc.
5. Takes in the root node of a tree and returns an array of leaf nodes (nodes with no children at the bottom of the tree)
6. Takes in the root node of a tree, a number, and changes all left-most nodes to the number
7. Takes in the root node of a tree, returns the largest width
8. Takes in the root node of a tree, returns the sum of all nodes
9. Takes in the root node of a tree, returns a new tree with the same values
10. Takes in the root node of a tree, sends the tree to the server (Interview question)
11. Takes in the root node of a tree, a number, and changes the value of each node to the value, one second after another.
12. Takes in root node of a tree (A), root node of tree(B), return if both trees have the same values for each node.

## Part 2

1. Given an array of objects (each object has cost, value) and a number (representing the amount of money you have), find the maximum value you can get.
2. Given a tree and the number of steps, return the maximum value you can get starting from root node.
3. Given an array of prices for a stock, return the maximum value you could have made (you can buy / sell at any time)
4. Given an array of prices for a stock, return the maximum value you could have made (you can buy / sell at any time, but each transaction costs $10)
5. Given an array of numbers and a value, return if any numbers add up to the value
6. Given an array of objects, each object has a (`from` and `to` property), return the shortest path for getting from 2 to 10. 
7. Given an array of objects that represents a city (`x` and `y`) and a number (max distance you can travel), return the maximum number of cities you can visit.
