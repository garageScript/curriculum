/* Count Islands
Given a matrix that represents a map,
return the number of isolated islands in the map.

The map has each value in the matrix representing a tile. A tile with a value
of 1 is a land tile, and a tile with a value of 0 is a water tile.

A land tile is part of the same island as any land tile that is on the
top, bottom, left, or right of the current tile.

Land tiles that are diagonal of each other are isolated islands as long as
there is no land tile, top, bottom, left, or right that connects both tiles.

    [1, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1],
    [0, 1, 0]
]) // returns 2

const solution = () => {
