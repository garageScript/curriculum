/* We define an anagram to be a word whose characters can be rearranged to create another word.
 * Given two strings, we want to know the minimum number of character in either string that we must
 * modify to make two strings anagrams.
 *
 * Write a function that returns an array of integers which denotes the minimum number of characters in either
 * array of strings that need to be modified to make two strings anagrams. If not possible, return -1
 * @params{Array, Array}
 * @returns{Array}
 *
 * Input1:
 * const a = ['abc']
 * const b = ['def']
 *
 * Output1: [-1]
 *
 * Input2:
 * const a = ['a', 'tea']
 * const b = ['bb', 'toe']
 *
 * Output2: [0, 1]
