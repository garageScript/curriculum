//## Exercises
//For each of these lesson, implement and run your solution
//function from your submitted challenges in JS0.

//1. Create UI for JS0 challenge 1 - Create 2 input box and a
//button. When you click on the button, alert the sum of the
//values in the 2 input boxes. 



//2. Create UI for JS0 challenge 3 -
//Create an input box and a button.

//When you click on the button, alert "Big" if the input
//number is greater than 5.

//Otherwise, nothing happens.



//3. Create UI for JS0 challenge 7 - Create 2 input box and a
//button.When you click on the button, alert true if the sum of the 2 inputs are greater than 10. Otherwise, alert false.



//4. Create UI for JS0 challenge 8 - Create 2 input box and 2
//buttons (call it generate and submit).
//When generate button is called, solution (for challenge 8)
//runs and a function is returned.
//
//When submit is called, the returned function runs and its
//result is alerted



//5. Create UI for JS0 challenge 9 - Create 2 input box and a
//button (call it generate). When generate button is called,
//solution (for challenge 9) runs and a function is returned. 



//There is a 3rd input box and another button (call it submit). 
//When submit button is called, run the returned function with 
//the third input and return the result.
